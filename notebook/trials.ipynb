       "['The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College  Dear State Senator\\'s Name,  I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, is a compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by Congress. Although many argue for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that keeping the Electoral College is essential for several reasons.  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In an election where disputes can arise, the winner of the Electoral College vote consistently achieves a greater share of electoral votes than their share of popular votes. This reduces the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election where President Obama received a higher proportion of electoral votes compared to his popular vote share.  Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of \"everyone\\'s president.\" As no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are pushed to cultivate trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning states that they are confident of winning, which would leave residents of other regions feeling disenfranchised.  Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. By using a winner-take-all system, candidates are motivated to concentrate their efforts on toss-up states, where voters pay close attention to the campaign and are more likely to make thoughtful decisions. This ensures that the most informed voters, who have received substantial attention and information from the candidates, have a significant influence in deciding the election\\'s outcome.  Furthermore, the Electoral College provides balance between large and small states. While the Senate\\'s mal-apportionment can lead to an imbalance in political weight, the Electoral College restores some of this balance. For instance, Florida, a large state, received more attention from presidential candidates in the 2012 elections compared to Wyoming, a small state, despite the popular vote being close in both states. This encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens in both populous and less populated areas.  Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate wins a majority of popular votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This eliminates the necessity and complications of run-off elections, ensuring a smooth and decisive determination of the president.  While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters by making their vote seemingly irrelevant, studies show that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. Voters participate in the elections to express their political preferences, rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will sway the national outcome.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical institution that preserves the integrity and balance of our democratic process. It guarantees a certain outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader audience, ensures thoughtful voting in swing states, balances the interests of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College to maintain the stability and fairness of our presidential elections.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the significance of the Electoral College in shaping a successful and representative democracy.  Sincerely,  Your Name',\n",
       " 'Think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere. I know I drive to school, to lacrosse practice, and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis. Some people may claim that driving is a positive aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timely fashion, but driving in excess has some serious consequences. Although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives, and that cutting down on driving would not be advantageous, limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages. Cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air, and make us healthier and happier, which is why many legislators and cities are reducing automobile use.  Beijing, China, is the most polluted city in the world according to Robert Duffer of the Chicago Tribune in 2014. source 2 paragraph 14 This is due to the fact that being\\'s automobile use is extremely high. When the city of Paris was faced with a similar crisis, it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their licence plate number, or they would face a fine. source 2 paragraph 1019. This revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in Paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day. The drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not advantageous. Cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because, according to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times in 2009 source 1 paragraph 5, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" Limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels, thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use.  Although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier, evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier. Rosenthal writes about the city of Vauban, Germany, where \"70% of vaughn\\'s families do not own a car.\" source 1 paragraph 3 Heidrum Walter, a carless citizen from Vauban, states that, \"When I had a car, I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" source 1 paragraph 3 The concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in Bogota, Columbia, where, according to Andrew Selsky of the Seattle Times in 2002, \"For the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million.\" source 3 paragraph 21 Carlos Arturo Plaza stated, \"It\\'s a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\"as he rode his bike with his wife. The statements from Walter of Vauban and Plaza of Bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall wellbeing and happiness of people, thus we should limit our automotive use.  Limiting automobile use is so beneficial, that many groups and legislators are supporting a society with less cars. The EPA in the United States is promoting \"car reduced\" communities, and legislators are starting to act. source 1 paragraph 9 David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, states that, \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.\" Sociology proffesor at Drecel University, Mimi Sheller, further elaborates, stating, \"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift.\" source 4 paragraph 35 The support for a \"car reduced\" society by the US government and the EPA is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less, thus we should limit our automobile use.  Society is changing. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. source 4 paragraph 41 Now is the time to turn off the engine, get out of the car, and take a bus, bike, or train to work. By limiting our automobile use, we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels, and we are happier and healthier, which is why organizations like the EPA support the reduction of car use. We need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction. The benefits of reducing car use are countless, which explains why we should limit our automobile use.',\n",
       " '  A Paradigm Shift in Urban Living  In an era marked by increasing urbanization and environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities is gaining momentum as a transformative solution to the complex challenges faced by metropolitan areas. Car-free cities are urban environments that prioritize sustainable transportation alternatives over private automobiles, aiming to create cleaner, healthier, and more vibrant urban spaces. This essay explores the concept of car-free cities, highlighting their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for successful implementation.  Car-free cities embody a vision of urban living that champions sustainability and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a significant role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This environmentally responsible approach is essential in addressing the urgent issue of climate change.  Public Health: The emphasis on pedestrian and cyclist safety in car-free cities results in fewer accidents and improved public health. Decreased air pollution levels lead to better respiratory and cardiovascular health for residents.  Optimal Use of Urban Space: Car-free cities efficiently repurpose urban space, transforming parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This revitalizes the urban landscape and enhances the overall quality of life.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly diminished, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful daily urban experience.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a costly endeavor. In car-free cities, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, the transition to car-free cities is not without its share of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes, leading to potential resistance to the transition due to concerns about convenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: The success of car-free cities hinges on the availability and efficiency of public transportation. Substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, offering convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and providing support to affected businesses is a crucial aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Redesigning urban areas for car-free living demands thorough planning and substantial investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  To successfully realize car-free cities, strategies include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation modes such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and prioritizing public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a compelling vision of a more sustainable and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthy goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent a promising glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.',\n",
       " 'How is the election of the president of the U.S.? The election is base on two parts, the first one is the Electoral College and the second one is the popular vote or the vote of the people. Changing to the election by popular vote would be a great idea because the president of the U.S. would be loved and accepted for most of the of the people in United States and it less complicated than the Electoral vote that can create a big mess.  According to the beginning of the U.S. Constitution ,\"We the people of the United States of America...\", it shows that the people have the right to change the government. When we select someone to be our leader we are selecting someone according to their values and to their actions before being the leader, but we are not selecting someone according to his political viewdemocrat or republican. In the Electoral college what they basically due is vote for the president who have the same political view as they have and if that person is going to help them in the future as president. So the Electoral College means business, while the popular vote select the president according to what is he going to do with the country. Also the 358 electors cannot represent the whole population of the United States, so basically they are not having a democratic system where everyone have a right. For example in 2000 when the election between Bush and Gore, Gore won the popular vote while Bush won the Electoral vote letting Bush won the presidency. After Bush won the presidency, he began sending soldiers to Afghanistan and Irac separating millions of U.S families, so the meaning is that people were right that Brush was not going to be a good president since the beginning, but at the end it was the fault of the Electoral College. Sometimes the Electoral College make a well political decision and could probably help more the government, while the people were just selecting someone that was going to destroy the government.  The popular vote is less complicated than the Electoral college where they have sometimes ties and controversies. their Electoral College sometimes is unfair against the popular, for example in Florida have 29 electoral votes while Wyoming have only 3 electoral votes is not fair to compare the two of them. The popular vote is easier, must of the times there are no ties so it woukld make it easy to select the president. In the other hand the popular vote would get really tie and one of the person that is running for president would ask for a recount of the vote, so it would take longer to select the president. Aslo if is there a tie in the Electoral College the election would be thrown at the House of Representative and giving the Senate the opportunity to select the president, leading to more complexity for choosing a president.  At the end the popular vote means the people\\'s vote and a fair election. Voting for the president of the United States is not an easy way, but as you read in the eassay you would see that the popular vote get the highest point for being the easiest one. Having a country that select their own president means that the countruy would accept anything that the precident is doing.',\n",
       " '\"In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously\". Car reduction helps the environment more than what people think it would. \"President Obama\\'s ambitious goals to curb the United states greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in America behavior:recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by\". Not having a car is better for you and the environment because not only would you be exercising by walking but there will be less pollution in the economy. Cars waste to much gas and have a lot of unnecessary waste in them that could end up to be one day global warming and kill of all the good air we breath in now. People should look in to not having a car and start walking, biking, skating and do more than what they use to do when they had a car.  Paris, Germany, United States, New York, Colombia and many other places are starting be more car free because they heard what cars can do to the environment. According the text \" in Colombia has a program that they started that spreads to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day the other day, leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\". The more and more people hear about this program the more people will get into the habit of not having a car or not using a car to go everywhere they have to go to. \"If the patterns persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants\".  Most people who are involved in the program see a huge difference in their community like the streets are cleaner, there are no traffic jams, the streets are safer, and there\\'s less pollution in the air. As we all know that cars are sometimes important to us to get to where we need to get but is it really that important to us to have a car not really because if we would stop being lazy and just get up from our couches and walk, bike, or skate to where we needed to go we\\'ll see that having a car is not as important as we used to think. In Colombia two other citizens joined the event and found that \"these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing broders\". So really one program can change the whole world if people just joined and saw for them selves what a huge impact it can be on others.  More parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city and there are more smooth sidewalks and restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. \"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift\". New York also started there own program which is this bikingsharing program and it\\'s skyrocketed bridge and the tunnel tools reflect those new priorities, and of course a proiferation of carsharing program across the nation. In some cities you have to take a car like in San Francisco because everything is so far away and you can not walk to where you need to go it will take forever to get there walking which is understandable. But in other cities or places were everything is close to you then there\\'s no point of taking a car instead of walking to the place you need to go to. Cars waste a lot of gas which means that gas prices go up way to much because of the usahe of cars instead of biking, skating, or walking. You get more done when your walking, biking, or skating because you are less worried about running out of gas or having to push the car to the nearest gas station.',\n",
       " '\"All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" Said David Goldberg. Nowadays Cars are our main Source when it comes to transportation.  Limiting your car usage should absolutely be more important in todays society. It\\'s plenty of things going on around us that most are unaware about, And limiting your car usage can be one thing to start helping to prevent these issues. Most cars give off alot of Pollution in the cities you live in an that effects animals. For example: The oil spill was a major problem in the ocean and that killed alot of animals an Demolished most of the sea life environmental foodchains. The capital of France had an intensifying amount of smog, but car traffic tended to decreased 60% after 5 days. Beijing China was known as the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel Fuel was the blame. You could even try those cars that dont require gas so the cities could be less polluted, But theres disadvantages to those cars as well.  At one point of time gas prices were sky high and people weren\\'t really satisfied with it. Now Gas prices have decreased an people are even more satisfied an happy to get gas. Saving up on gas would help out alot to in todays world as well. How? Because Everything in life has a Big Fat Price tag on it so to help save up to get better things or things you need you can probably go for not paying for Gas as much. Everyday around 5:00 or 5:30 there\\'s something called 5:00 traffic. When everyone is just about getting off work, headed to night school, going to the store, or whatever the case may be. This is the craziest time of the day to drive an your just ready to get home an dont feel like dealing with traffic.... you can take the City bus, Subway, or maybe even walk if its not far. Some people may call you crazy but it reduces the amount of money being spent on gas. its only maybe like 10cents to ride the city bus i believe...But the point is your saving money. Then by the time you finally decide \"Oh i would like to drive my car\" your tank would be full cause you havent been driving it so you wouldnt have to stop for gas. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \" Car Reduced\" Communities, and Legislators are starting to act. Many Experts expect public transportation to play a Larger Role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill approved this year, Said Mr. Goldberg. Walking isnt always quite bad. Look on the bright side your Burning Calories, shedding pounds, and if you run your building you Endurance. Instead of having to drive to a gym far away walk to a nearest one an have a pre workout by jogging or running there. Same thing applies to Bicycling.  Nowadays since majority of the United States own cars Traffic is horrible at certain hours of the day. Most people are too impatient for the wait or become aggressive drivers which is most likely to cause accidents. Maybe your ready to get home after a horrible day or your really tired from work an you realize your about to run into 5:00 Traffic an it\\'ll be forever until you finally get home. If taking the City Buses or subways you won\\'t have to deal with all that pressure. On a City bus you can just have a seat chit chat with other people as they hop on or just relax until you get to your destination. If your really tired you could just tell someone to wake you up when its time to. At least it\\'ll be better then you being behind the wheel. If your workplace is Walking or Bicycling distance then you should feel even better to just scroll past all the people having to deal with the traffic. \"Its a Good opportunity to take away stress and Lower Air pollution\" Said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat Bicycle with his wife.  Fellow Citizens should understand the Advantages of limiting their car usage because of the Pollution, To Save up on gas, and Less stress to deal with Traffic. Maybe one day cities would take more action an save up on gas for these reasons.',\n",
       " 'Your Name Your Address City, State, Zip Date  Senator\\'s Name Senator\\'s Address City, State, Zip  Dear Senator Senator\\'s Last Name,  I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a direct popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves important functions and benefits the democratic process in several ways.  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of the outcome. As outlined in \"In Defense of the Electoral College\" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system significantly reduces the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. Additionally, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the potential for a nationwide electoral vote tie is highly unlikely. The Electoral College provides a clear winner with an indisputable majority.  Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is representative of the entire country, rather than just a specific region. As stated in Posner\\'s article, a presidential candidate must have trans-regional appeal to garner enough electoral votes for victory. This prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from becoming president, which could result in other regions feeling disenfranchised and disconnected from their leader. The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across different regions and take into account the interests of the entire country.  Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This helps to ensure that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of these states and their voters. As mentioned in Posner\\'s article, voters in swing states are more likely to be informed and engaged, as they know their votes will have a significant impact on the election outcome. This could lead to more thoughtful and informed decision-making by voters.  Fourthly, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political representation of large and small states. Posner argues that the Electoral College compensates for the inequality in the Senate by giving more weight to large states in the presidential election. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on populous states while neglecting the interests of smaller states. It promotes a more equitable distribution of attention and resources during the campaign process.  Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This reduces the complexity and costs associated with run-off elections, as outlined by Posner. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, even if the popular vote results in a plurality instead of a majority for a candidate.  While opponents argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to note that voter participation is driven by the desire to express political preferences rather than the belief in a single vote having the potential to decide an election, as mentioned in Posner\\'s article.  In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses campaigns on swing states, restores balance between large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. It is a fundamental process that protects the democratic values upheld by our founding fathers. I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College when making decisions related to this important aspect of our democratic system.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Sincerely,  Your Name',\n",
       " 'Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals and communities. This is a growing trend in many parts of the world, including Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can improve the environment, promote alternative transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and create healthier and more sustainable communities.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. According to the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.  In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also help reduce air pollution. The article \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer highlights the impact of car-free days in Paris. After days of intense smog, the city enforced a partial driving ban, which resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a decrease in air pollution. This shows that by limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier living conditions for residents.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. As mentioned in the article \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day, leading to streets devoid of traffic jams. By promoting alternative transportation and reducing the number of cars on the road, we can alleviate congestion and create more efficient and accessible transportation systems.  Limiting car usage also has social and economic benefits. In the article \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is mentioned that car ownership rates have been decreasing in the United States. This shift in behavior can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as well as reduce the dependence on the car industry. Additionally, by promoting alternative transportation methods, such as biking and walking, we can create more vibrant and economically flourishing communities. The article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" provides an example of Vauban, Germany, where residents have given up their cars and have a more enjoyable and stress-free lifestyle.  In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can improve the environment, promote alternative transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and create healthier and more sustainable communities. The examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States show that this trend is gaining popularity and can have a positive impact on both individuals and society as a whole. It is important for us to consider these advantages and work towards reducing car usage for a better and greener future.',\n",
       " \"  Dear Senator Senator's Last Name,  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and to advocate for its retention in the process of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides numerous benefits that would be lost if it were abolished.  First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in a presidential election. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and challenges to the election results, as observed in the 2000 election. The winner-take-all system in most states also contributes to this certainty, as even a minor lead in a state can result in a significant electoral vote advantage.  Additionally, the Electoral College guarantees that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, forcing candidates to appeal to multiple regions and address the concerns of a diverse range of voters. This ensures that the president represents and takes into account the interests of citizens from all parts of the country, fostering national unity.  The swing state concept, facilitated by the Electoral College, is another compelling reason to retain this system. It encourages candidates to campaign in toss-up states and closely engage with voters in these crucial regions. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, carefully consider their choices, and make informed decisions. This allows the most thoughtful voters to have a significant say in selecting the president.  The Electoral College also gives large states the political weight they deserve. Without the Electoral College, smaller states would have disproportionately less influence in presidential elections due to their lower populations and fewer electoral votes. The Electoral College balances this disparity and incentivizes candidates to pay attention to the concerns and needs of voters in both large and small states.  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This ensures a clear and decisive winner, avoiding the confusion and complications that would arise from further rounds of voting. It simplifies the presidential election process and provides a more efficient way to determine the next president.  While there are criticisms of the Electoral College, such as the argument that it discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to note that voter participation is primarily driven by the desire to express a political preference. Furthermore, addressing this concern does not necessitate the abandonment of the Electoral College, but rather calls for initiatives to encourage voter engagement and provide information about the importance of their vote.  In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system, ensuring certainty, national representation, and balanced political influence. It is not a perfect system, but the benefits it provides outweigh the disadvantages. I urge you to consider these points and support the retention of the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Sincerely,  Your Name\",\n",
       " 'Code  Dear Senator Last Name,  I am writing to express my viewpoint on the matter of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After careful consideration of various arguments, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained as the method for selecting the President.  First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the election process. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winner\\'s share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. With a majority of electoral votes being required to elect the President, there is a higher level of certainty in determining the winner (Posner 18).  Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a sense of collective ownership and representation for all citizens across the nation. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, ensuring that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from becoming president, promoting a more inclusive leadership that considers the interests of all regions (Posner 19).  Another significant advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to emphasize the importance of swing states. As noted by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method motivates candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This encourages voters in these states to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to more thoughtful and informed decisions. Toss-up states become the deciding factor in the election, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the power to shape the outcome (Posner 20).  Additionally, the Electoral College grants due importance to large states. Judge Posner explains how the Electoral College balances the weight of large states losing representation due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, as their victories yield a higher number of electoral votes. This maintains a political balance that acknowledges the diverse needs and interests of both small and large states (Posner 21).  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate achieves a majority of the popular votes, this could lead to further complications in the election process. With the Electoral College, the clear winner is determined based on the majority of electoral votes received, ensuring a decisive outcome (Posner 22).  While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in \"non-competitive\" states, the fact remains that people vote to express their political preference rather than in the belief that their vote alone will decide the election (Posner 23). The Electoral College system upholds the fundamentals of our democratic process while maintaining a fair and effective means to elect the President.  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved as the method of electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure certainty, foster unity and representation, highlight swing states, provide importance to large states, and avoid run-off elections are all valuable advantages that contribute to the effectiveness of our democratic system.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will carefully consider the benefits of maintaining the Electoral College in future discussions on this issue.  Sincerely,  Your Name',\n",
       " 'When each person drives a dieseltussling car, it is like several thousand smoke covered knives being thrown at the soft protective blanket up in the sky. Pollution is destroying our ozone and our environment, but now we need to face our ramifications. Autos are causing cities to form new laws banning these leeches from being driven. Car usage should be limited, because if we dont, our pollution will be worse than it already is, and using a healthy alternative to transportation will lead to a healthier life style.  Pollution produced by our main method of transportation is killing our planet. We live on the wonderful planet earth which has been generous to provide us with a home and food so we can survive, but when our home is destroyed, we will soon become extinct. Global warming is a famous term heard around the globe, and this word is not used lightly. Our world is heating up due to the many green house gasses produced by the emissions of the cars we use. These green house gasses can not escape our atmosphere which then is heated up by the sun and is melting our polar ice caps. These ice caps, not only will flood multiple cities, killing thousands if they do not escape in time, but they also hold our natural fresh water reserve. The green house gasses are affecting our seas and our skies as well. An article called Paris Bans Sriving Due to Smog , written by Robert Duffer, states that \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\" Beijing is also one of the worlds most populated countries. The terrifying smog and the rising seas are not the only factors leading to our demise. The green house gasses are producing holes in our ozone that protect us from harmful sun rays. Without the ozone, the world would not be habitable because of all the cancer humans will have by just standing in direct sunlight. We are the world, and by killing the world, we eradicate our whole species. We need to help our world with some healthy substitutions to cars.  There are several different ways transportation could be healthy for both the environment and ourselves. The worlds obesity population is higher than ever. An average amount of calories we need to consume per day is about 2000 calories and most of the world are consuming way over that limit. If we supply bicycles to cities, we could burn off those extra calories by just going to public places, events,and even jobs. Biking and walking to places not only work out your physical apearance, but also keeps our mind healthy. Exercise trigger neurotransmitters in your brain to fire off endorphins, like adrenaline, which keeps your body moving and working without putting strain on your muscles. Exercise also fires off dopamine in your mind which produces a sense of joy. Elisabeth Rosenthal wrote an article named \" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars \" which interviews people from germany about their lifestyle. \"\\'When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way,\\' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.\" Life is much more jovial with no cars, and germany knows it.  There are already different countries that have moderated and replaced their walking smoke factories to their fat burning bikes. We need to follow in their foot steps and moderate if we do not want to be left in the dark ages. The government needs to limit the amount of usage for cars, because the constant use of autos will lead to out doom via pollution, and without cars, people are more likley to live more healthy and happy lifestyle.',\n",
       " 'Dear Mr. Senator, I have decided to express my opinion to you about the Electoral College process for electing the President of the United States. This process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the American peoples opinion. We should instead switch to a popular vote by eligible American citizens to decide presidency.  Now some fellows might argue that the Electoral College is favored by the people. When in fact, as Bradford Plumer points out in paragraph 9, \"60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now\". Some people may also say that the Electoral college encourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. A president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as california who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who dont invest as much thought into their votes.  In grade school we are taught that popular votes most accurately represent what a specific population wants, why dont we use it in the real world? If your principle wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, she would not elect people to decide for each class! In the Bush and Gore election, Bush received less votes by the American people but won presidency because he acquired more Electoral votes than Gore. That means that more American people wanted Gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected Bush as the winner!  The Electoral College also increases the risk of a tie and if one occurred, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. In 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 Electors.  The overall idea im trying to express is that the Electoral College is a poor way to show peoples opinion, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the President of the United States. I hope you can see my points and I long for the day when the president is decided by the people.',\n",
       " \"  Dear Senator Senator’s Last Name,  I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of maintaining this unique system for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe the Electoral College is crucial in ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the American people.  One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur compared to when the popular vote is the determining factor. With almost all states awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, providing a clear and decisive result.  Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. As Posner states, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful, as they need to gain support from various regions and take into account the interests of all Americans. This helps prevent candidates from focusing solely on populous areas or ignoring states with lower population densities. It ensures that the president represents the nation as a whole, avoiding a scenario where only certain states or regions receive attention and influence.  Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the election outcome is less predictable. This forces candidates to address the specific concerns and needs of swing state voters, who are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and be informed about the competing candidates. By engaging with swing state voters, candidates have to appeal to a broader range of voters and address a wider range of issues, ultimately leading to better-informed decisions and policies.  Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives sufficient weight to large states, ensuring that they have a significant influence in the political process. Posner highlights that the popular vote in a large state like Florida can have a substantial impact through the allocation of electoral votes. This balances the power between large and small states, ensuring that candidates do not solely focus on the biggest states and neglect the concerns of smaller states. This balanced approach allows for a more comprehensive representation of the diverse needs and interests of the American people.  Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the problem of having run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In such a scenario, there would be pressure for further elections, which would complicate the presidential election process. By having the Electoral College, we ensure that a clear winner is determined in a timely manner, preventing any uncertainty or ambiguity in the election results.  While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in non-competitive states from participating, the fact remains that nearly half of the eligible American population still voted in the 2012 election, suggesting that voters are motivated by a desire to express their political preferences rather than the belief that a single vote will decide the outcome.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is a process that has stood the test of time and has proven effective in providing a fair representation of the American people. It allows for certainty of outcome, ensures that every region's voice is heard, encourages candidates to engage with swing state voters, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections.  I would urge you to consider these points when discussing any potential changes to our electoral system. The Electoral College, while not perfect, is a valuable institution that upholds the principles of democracy and ensures a fair representation for all Americans.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely,  Your Name\",\n",
       " 'Numerous amount of people would love to experience the opportunities of limiting their time with their car. There are a great amount of advantages of limiting car usage. Advantages include having a more healthy environment, decreasing stress, and reducing traffic.  The advantages of limiting car usage is helping the environment. \"passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\" While most of the adult population is driving cars everyday, more gas and smoke go into the air and into our environment. This causes pollution and hurts our environment. Paris has a major smog problem in their environment, up to the point where it was nearrecorded. Paris had to then enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The effect of this ban was that congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared after a short week. If we were able to limit our car usage, then our greenhouse gas emissions would decrease. \"In the United States, the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act.\" There are numerous environmental agencies that are already starting to act to decrease the car usage in the country. We should limit our car usage because it can greatly help our environment.  If were able to limit our car usage, then it will greatly decrease our stress of driving. Many countries are trying to reduce car usage. An example is Columbia. Columbia has created a carfree day. \"Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses during carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" Bogota, Colombia have practiced this day for three years and many colombians have been pleased with it. \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\", said businessman Carlos Plaza. Without driving, you have the time to go out, be active and get exercise. A huge effect of the car free day is that park and sport centers have been built all throughout Bogota, smoother sidewalks, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. With car usage reduced, it limit people\\'s stress on driving.  If we were able to lower the number of car usage, then our streets would be much safer and there would be less traffic. Many people use cars today and because of that most of streets are usually blocked up. If there were less cars on the streets then it would be easier and quicker to go to places. Vanban, Germany is an example of an carfree town. \"...basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls alond some distant highway.\" With less cars on the streets, it can also reduce car accidents and deaths. If there were less cars on the roads, there would be less traffic and car accidents.  There are many advantages of limiting our car usage. These advantages include helping our environment, decreasing stress, and making our roads safer with less traffic.',\n",
       " \"  Dear Senator Last Name,  I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College system for selecting the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the arguments presented both in favor of keeping the current system and changing to a popular vote. After analyzing the information from multiple sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College system should be retained for the following reasons.  Firstly, the certainty of outcome provided by the Electoral College is crucial in ensuring a smooth and clear election process. While disputes over the outcome of electoral votes are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is mainly because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. Moreover, the winner-take-all method in most states creates a landslide victory for the candidate with even a slight plurality, minimizing the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.  Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president who represents the interests of the entire nation. The requirement for a candidate to have trans-regional appeal ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents a candidate with only regional support from becoming president and neglecting the interests of other regions. It fosters a sense of inclusivity and avoids the perception of disenfranchisement among voters in states with fewer electoral votes.  Furthermore, the focus on swing states incentivizes candidates to campaign extensively in those states. This means that voters in swing states have a greater chance of engaging with and critically evaluating the different candidates. These voters are likely to be the most informed and thoughtful, making them the ideal group to decide the outcome of the election. By directing campaign efforts towards swing states, the Electoral College system promotes a more informed electorate.  In addition, the Electoral College balances the political importance of large and small states. While large states may lose some weight in the political balance due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, the Electoral College system ensures that candidates pay attention to and campaign in all states, regardless of their size. Small states are not marginalized, as victories with even a small margin in those states still contribute to the overall electoral vote count, giving them a voice in the election process.  Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process. By invariably producing a clear winner, it ensures a decisive outcome that avoids prolonged election disputes or the need for additional rounds of voting. This streamlines the process and provides stability in electing the president.  While some argue against the Electoral College, claiming it is unfair, outdated, and irrational, the practical reasons to retain it far outweigh these assertions. The current system has been effective in ensuring certainty, broader representation, informed voting, fair political balance, and avoiding run-off elections. These benefits are vital in maintaining a functioning democratic process in the United States.  Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments for and against the Electoral College system before making any decisions. It is my hope that you will support the continuation of this vital process that has served our democracy well for over two centuries.  Yours sincerely,  Your Name\",\n",
       " 'In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College  Dear Senator Last Name,  I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has its advantages and should be retained.  One of the strengths of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of the presidential election. As stated in \"In Defense of the Electoral College\" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate\\'s share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the election results are more decisive and less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. In instances where there is a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, the election is thrown to the House of Representatives, ensuring that a clear winner is determined.  Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president is representative of all regions of the country. As Judge Posner explains, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages presidential candidates to campaign in different states, rather than focusing solely on populous areas. This way, candidates must appeal to a diverse range of voters and address the concerns of various regions. This keeps the president accountable to the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a few heavily populated areas.  The system of swing states, which is inherent in the Electoral College, also has its advantages. In \"In Defense of the Electoral College,\" Judge Posner argues that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on closely contested states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates, making them more informed and engaged in the election process. These swing states often represent a diverse cross-section of the population, ensuring that the president is responsive to a wide range of viewpoints and concerns.  Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. Judge Posner explains that the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states less political weight. By awarding electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College gives larger states more attention in presidential campaigns. This ensures that the interests and concerns of both large and small states are taken into account during elections.  Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, as explained by Judge Posner. This prevents complications and delays in the election process. It also ensures that a clear winner is determined, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This helps maintain confidence in the election results and prevents prolonged political uncertainty.  While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College system, such as the argument that it may discourage some voters in \"sure-win\" states from participating, the benefits of the system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides stability, representation, and accountability in the election process.  In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College when considering any potential changes to the presidential election system. It is clear that this system has its merits and has served our country well for centuries. I believe that preserving the Electoral College will uphold the principles on which our democracy was founded.  Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I look forward to your continued dedication to serving the best interests of our state and our nation.  Sincerely,  Your Name',\n",
       " 'The Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.  At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for?\" and \"Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?\". The answers werenot always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.  The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electoral confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is\\'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees\\'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guaranteed, will not happen with that comparison.  A winner take all system is in play with the electoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candidates focus more on those states to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.  All in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.',\n",
       " \"Favorable Argument Regarding the Electoral College  Dear State Senator's Name,  I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College as a system for electing the President of the United States. While there has been a growing movement advocating for the popular vote to determine the winner, I believe that preserving the Electoral College is vital for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system implemented by most states allows for a landslide victory in electoral votes with even a slight plurality in a state. This prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, ensuring a clear winner in the election process.  Another crucial aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to make the president accountable to all regions of the country. As Judge Posner noted, the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from being elected. This, in turn, prevents certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and ensures that the president will represent the interests of all Americans. Without this requirement, candidates may focus their campaign efforts solely on heavily populated regions, ignoring the concerns of less populous areas.  The Electoral College also encourages candidates to reach out to swing states, which are crucial in determining election outcomes. As Judge Posner explained, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign heavily in these toss-up states. This fosters increased voter engagement and allows for the most thoughtful voters to decide the election. By focusing on swing states, candidates must address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters, leading to more comprehensive and representative policies.  Furthermore, the Electoral College preserves a balance of power, particularly for larger states. Since the composition of Congress already provides an advantage for less populous states, the Electoral College helps maintain equilibrium by granting larger states more attention during campaigns. As Judge Posner stated, a victory in a large state like Florida yields significantly more electoral votes compared to a small state like Wyoming. This reaffirms the importance of catering to the needs and wants of citizens living in larger states, ensuring their voices are heard in the election process.  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the necessity for run-off elections. While rare, instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast can be problematic to resolve. The Electoral College provides a straightforward solution by invariably producing a clear winner. This prevents the complications and costs associated with conducting run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is a process carefully established by our founding fathers to balance the interests of all states and ensure a fair and representative presidential election. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, makes the president accountable to all regions, encourages candidates to engage with swing states, preserves a balance of power between large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I implore you to support the preservation of the Electoral College to uphold these fundamental principles.  Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the importance of maintaining the Electoral College for the well-being of our democratic system.  Sincerely,  Your Name\",\n",
       " 'Recently, in many countries around the world, there have been actions made towards the reduction or complete banishment of most automobiles in order to help advance society. In Paris, there was a law enacted forcing drivers to leave their cars at home every other day. A majority of the reasoning behind such a ban was the pollution that were constantly emitted into the atmosphere. This is not only accepted by the general public, but some even say that their stress was much lower than with automobiles in daily life.  The people who give up their vehicles to live in Vauban, Germany report having less stress than when they did use cars as daily transportation. As stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer who lives in Vauban, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" In this experimental suburban community, places to park a car are forbidden in most areas. They go as far as to rid of all driveways and parking lots in the community. This creates more spaces or businesses to operate, causing all stores to be built closer to households. This in turn makes getting to and from places faster and safer. The people in Paris also prefer the decreased amount of vehicles during rush hour, which alleviates their stress tremendously when navigating the city. This has affected less major cities also, such as Bogota. Their annual carfree day has lead to the construction of over 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the longest amount in any Latin country. Not only that, but other recreational activity centers have also emerged throughout the city, according the mayor of Bogota.  Pollution has had a large impact in large, carintensified cities like Paris, which was, at some points, comparable to places with the most pollution. The smog eventually resided, but some aspects of the ban still remained. The cars there typically use diesel over gasoline due to tax policies that prefer it specifically. Thus, about two thirds of the vehicles in France prefer diesel engines, which are to blame for the smog that engulfed Paris. According the New York Times, Passenger cars in Europe are responsible for twelve percent of the total greenhouse emissions. The percentage in the United States is over four times that in some congested areas.  The cities of Paris, Vauban, and Bogota are few of the many global areas that have taken on the challenge of removing cars from their daily lives, which has benefited both their health and their environment. This is a part of the longterm shift in our societies\\' way of commuting from one place to another. The amount of people going to get driver licesnses has been on a decline since 2005 in the United States, and is projected the continue that path for a long time. In fact, there was a twenty three percent decrease in young poeple driving form 2001 to 2009. People are alreading seeing the benefits of decreasing the use of cars, and the amount of traffic is only going to keep decreasing. As a local businessman in Bogota said, \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.',\n",

Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding runoff elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice.  For various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral college. In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just because they can even though us other people do count.  The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. \"It\\'s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!\" Plumer, Source 2 and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. \".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now\" Plumer, Source 2 every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000.  Lastly, the electoral college is irrational like seriously what idiotic person came up with this. I will say this again, but a monkey could of made a better system than this. \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party\\'s central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate? Sometimes\" Plumer, Source 2 I know this statement says it all because how could one simply not want popular vote after reading this.  I know that electoral college vote can help and not cause problems, but there are more problems while there is one easy fix which is popular vote. \"It\\'s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" Plumer, Source 2.',\n",
       " \"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections  I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a crucial and fair method of ensuring a balanced representation of the American people in the presidential election process.  Firstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a popular vote and electing the President by a vote in Congress. As outlined in The Office of the Federal Register's text, the process consists of the selection of electors who vote for the President and Vice President, as well as the counting of electoral votes by Congress. This system ensures that each state has a say in the election, with the number of electors being directly proportional to the state's representation in Congress.  One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains in his defense of the Electoral College, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral vote is less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because a winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is almost always greater than their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state also leads to a landslide electoral vote victory, giving a clear indication of the people's choice.  Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal, as outlined by Judge Posner. This prevents candidates with only regional support from being elected, promoting a president who can effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. Additionally, swing states play a significant role in the electoral process, attracting candidates to campaign and engage with voters in those states. This results in more thoughtful voters who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, consequently making an informed decision.  Another vital aspect is that the Electoral College restores balance to the political power distribution between large and small states. As Judge Posner indicates, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from candidates during campaigns, ensuring that their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states. This consideration for both large and small states is crucial for maintaining a fair and equal representation of all Americans in the electoral process.  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections, as pointed out by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the potential complications associated with run-off elections and ensures a decisive outcome.  While critics of the Electoral College argue that it may limit voter participation in states where a particular candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to emphasize that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express their political preferences, as Judge Posner highlights. The continuation of the Electoral College recognizes the reality that no single vote will swing a national election and that voters participate to have their voices heard, regardless of the electoral outcome in their state.  In conclusion, the Electoral College remains an essential system for electing the President of the United States. It ensures a fair representation of all citizens, guarantees a clear and decisive outcome, and maintains balance between large and small states. While recognizing the need for improvements in our electoral process, I firmly believe that abolishing the Electoral College would undermine the principles on which it was established. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our current system.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the benefits of the Electoral College and the potential consequences of abandoning it. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.  Yours sincerely,  Your Name\",\n",
       " 'Support for the Electoral College  Dear Senator\\'s Last Name,  I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the arguments for both keeping the Electoral College and switching to direct election by popular vote. After reviewing multiple sources, including The Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner\\'s article, \"In Defense of the Electoral College,\" I firmly believe that the Electoral College is essential in maintaining the fairness and effectiveness of our electoral process.  One of the key benefits of the Electoral College system is that it provides certainty of outcome. As mentioned by Judge Posner, while disputes over the electoral vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state ensures that a candidate with even a slight plurality in a state secures a landslide electoral-vote victory. Thus, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral vote exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of tied elections and potential disputes.  Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters the idea of a president who represents all Americans. Unlike a direct popular vote, where candidates could focus their efforts only on densely populated areas, the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner argues, this regional diversity ensures that no single region dominates the election, preventing the majority from feeling disenfranchised. This is crucial for a successful presidency, as it encourages candidates to engage with diverse perspectives and address the needs of citizens across the country.  Another advantage of the Electoral College system is that it leads to a focus on swing states. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates are incentivized to campaign and invest resources in swing states. As noted in the text, voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention and become better-informed voters. This ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged citizens have a greater influence on election outcomes, enhancing the democratic process as a whole.  Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance among states of different sizes. It counteracts the mal-apportionment of the Senate by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. As the text points out, a narrow popular vote victory in a large state like Florida yields significantly more electoral votes than a similar victory in a small state such as Wyoming. This maintains a sense of fairness and political balance, preventing larger states from dominating smaller ones.  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, ensuring clear winners in presidential elections. In circumstances where no candidate receives a majority in the popular vote, as seen with Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College guarantees a decisive outcome. Avoiding run-off elections streamlines the election process and saves valuable time and resources.  While I acknowledge the arguments against the Electoral College, such as it being undemocratic and potentially leading to swing state dominance, I firmly believe that the benefits it provides outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College upholds fairness, promotes trans-regional representation, encourages swing state engagement, balances state influence, and avoids run-off elections.  In conclusion, I respectfully urge you to support the continued use of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. Its practical advantages and the safeguards it provides against potential election disputes and domination by a few regions highlight the importance of this system for the integrity of our democracy.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective, along with the information presented from multiple sources, when contemplating any potential changes to our election process.  Sincerely,  Your Name',\n",
       " 'Your Name Your Address City, State, ZIP Email Address Phone Number Date  Senator\\'s Name Senator\\'s Address City, State, ZIP  Dear Senator Senator\\'s Last Name,  I am writing to express my opinion on the current electoral process for the election of the President of the United States. Specifically, I want to discuss the importance of keeping the Electoral College system or changing to an election by popular vote. After reading and analyzing several sources on the topic, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained due to its practical advantages and ability to ensure a fair and representative election.  One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College, as outlined in the passage from the Office of the Federal Register, is the certainty of outcome (Posner, 2016, p. 18). By requiring a candidate to win a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate has broad support across various regions of the country (Posner, 2016, p. 19). This is crucial to maintaining a diverse and inclusive democracy, as it prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas while neglecting the interests and needs of less populous states and regions (Posner, 2016, p. 21).  Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the concept of \"everyone\\'s president\" by encouraging candidates to appeal to voters from different regions and not just concentrate on swing states (Posner, 2016, p. 19). This helps to prevent regional biases and ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just particular regions. It also avoids the potential for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process and may not necessarily result in a clear winner (Posner, 2016, p. 22).  Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages campaigns to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is less predictable (Posner, 2016, p. 20). This promotes voter engagement and participation, as voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and listen to the competing candidates (Posner, 2016, p. 20). By giving greater attention to swing states, candidates can better understand and address the concerns of a wider range of voters, leading to a more representative outcome.  While there are arguments in favor of a popular vote system, such as the notion that it may increase voter turnout, these arguments do not outweigh the advantages of the Electoral College system (Plumer, 2016, p. 13). In fact, the Electoral College ensures that elections can be decided with relative certainty and prevents scenarios where a slight plurality of votes can result in a contested outcome (Posner, 2016, p. 18). This helps to uphold the integrity of the election process and maintain public trust and confidence in the system.  In conclusion, I urge you to consider the practical advantages of the Electoral College system, as outlined in the texts provided. By maintaining the Electoral College, we can ensure fair representation, prevent regional biases, and promote voter engagement across the nation. While improvements can be made to the system, I believe that completely abandoning the Electoral College would be a disservice to the principles of our democracy. Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely,  Your Name',\n",
       " 'The Electoral College is broken, and with another election on the way, here is why the voting should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Voters cannot control whom their electors are, in the chance that those electors are replaced with new electors so the votes may be rigged, as well as \"faithless\" electors may refuse to vote for their party\\'s candidate and could cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.  Voters don\\'t actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you\\'d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it\\'s the state\\'s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citizens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn\\'t be.  In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. because each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming. This cannot represent the will of the people.  Now when have you changed your mind about something? Electors can do the same. Electors can refuse to vote for their party\\'s candidate and vote for whomever they please. That can\\'t be right, yet it has happened plenty of times before. It\\'s even unfair to the people, who sometimes don\\'t even get to see their electors. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, they don\\'t focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards \"swing states.\" In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn\\'t see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn\\'t get to see not one campaign ad.  The Electoral College dosen\\'t hear the voice of the people, hardly plays by the rules, is something that should be erased. Even people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dale, the U.S.',\n",
       " \"Your Name Your Address City, State, ZIP Email Address Phone Number Date  Senator's Name Senator's Address City, State, ZIP  Subject: The Need to Maintain the Electoral College System  Dear Senator Senator's Last Name,  I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a shift to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College has several significant advantages that should not be overlooked. In this letter, I will outline the benefits of the Electoral College, address counterarguments, and provide evidence from various sources to support my claims.  Firstly, one of the key advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the elected president has majority support across different regions of the country, preventing candidates from merely focusing on highly populated areas and neglecting the interests of smaller states (Posner, 18). By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign and address the concerns of voters from all parts of the country (Posner, 19).  Furthermore, the Electoral College safeguards against the possibility of run-off elections. Unlike in countries with direct popular vote systems, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner is selected without the need for further elections. This prevents the process from being drawn out and complicated, as seen in other countries. For instance, the 1968 and 1992 elections had candidates who won the presidency with only a plurality of the popular vote, but still secured a majority in the Electoral College (Posner, 22). The Electoral College acts as a safeguard against prolonged and potentially chaotic election processes.  Additionally, the Electoral College gives smaller states a fair voice in the election. As Judge Posner explains, the large states already have an advantage in terms of representation in the Senate due to the Constitution's mal-apportionment. By awarding electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College restores the balance of political weight, ensuring that smaller states are not underrepresented (Posner, 21).  While some argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, it is important to consider the practical reasons for its continuation. As mentioned by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and direct popular vote (Federal Register, 1). It offers a middle ground that combines the benefits of both methods.  In conclusion, the Electoral College system is beneficial for the United States as it guarantees certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, restores balance for large states, and avoids run-off elections. Despite the occasional criticisms and calls for change, the Electoral College system has stood the test of time and has proven to be a fair and effective method for electing the President of the United States.  Thank you for considering my perspective. I trust that you will carefully contemplate the advantages of the Electoral College system before supporting any potential changes.

       " 'As human beings we must care for the earth that was so kindly bestowed upon us, meaning we must do all in our power to prevent it from selfdestructing due to our carelessness. One way we seem to have recently discover we can make a difference is that the limiting of car usage is an enormous step towards our goal. Cars have been a topic of controversy worldwide, as it seems people refused to stop the usage of such a helpful tool in todays society, but as time goes on we have opened our eyes to a world of better choices. Citizens from all around see that car usage can be cut down, and it will be an astonishing change for both humans, as well as the earth. The limitation of car usage will provide a more healthy environment for the earth as well as those who live on it. Cars are a simply a machine in which we have allowed ourselves to believe that life can not go on without it. Here we will discover how truley wrong we were.  Although we all understand that these vehicles allow use to save much time by getting us to our destinations quicker, it does alot of harm to our planet as well. As stated in the article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\", cars are responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emission in certain areas of the United states. The fuel we use to power our cars is released into the OZone layer, and into our atmosphere which creates a greenhouse affect and slowly, but surley destroys our environment. However, we have the power to protect the planet we live on for we have so many different choices of transportation that causes way less harm. Cutting down on driving is a simple task in which we can all participate in.  Next we focus more on how car limitation affects ourselves. Driving take a toll on us because other forms of transportation do so much good towards ones self being, but as humans we seem to always take the easy way out. If we didnt always use cars, and took a walk for instance it would improve health as well as many other things. In an artice written by Andrew Selsky it states that \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" The less smog in the air, the better we can breath which will improve our health, and walking is good for that as well. We don\"t need cars to live our lives. Life goes on without the use of a machine.  All in all cars we must care for this world as well as ourselves, and this is the first step towards this goal. Some fear that this change in society will have horrible consequences because we are so use to cars in our life, but these vehicles dont control us. By use limiting car usage we are providing a healthier environment for both human beings as well as our earth. Lets take the steps toward making this world a better place to live for us as well as the many generations to come.',\n",
       " \"Title: Limiting Car Usage: A Pathway to Sustainable Urban Living   Our current society has metamorphosed into an era of rapid urbanization, invariably buttressed by immense reliance on private vehicles. This pattern has generated an alarming increase in environmental pollution, presented challenges in urban planning, and induced significant health risks. It is against this backdrop that the concept of reducing car usage has been propounded, thereby fostering sustainable urban living.  The residential district of Vauban in Germany presents an intriguing instance of successful car limitation. According to Rosenthal (2009), users are required to purchase parking spaces separately from their homes, making car owning less appealing. Consequently, a significant proportion, almost 70% of Vauban’s families, do not own cars. By minimizing car usage, Vauban generates lower greenhouse gas emissions – a critical contributor to climate change. This strategy is also crucial in tackling tailpipe emissions, which amount to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in car-centric regions in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009).  Prolonged car usage also engenders devastating air pollution issues, as seen in Paris during a period of near-record pollution. To combat this, city officials implemented a partial driving ban, resulting in a remarkable 60% decrease in congestion and a significant reduction in the smog level (Duffer, 2014). A similar strategy was deployed in Bogota, Colombia, where a car-free day led to the streets being notably devoid of traffic jams (Selsky, 2002). These practical scenarios strongly indicate that reducing car usage indeed fosters a healthier environment, characterized by fewer greenhouse gases and less air pollution.  Less reliance on vehicles does more than improving the environment; it also significantly enhances our quality of life. Vauban’s 'car-free' streets are safer and more peaceful, creating a more conducive environment for walking and biking (Rosenthal, 2009). Limiting car usage also encourages more use of public transportation, promoting collective communal experiences and ultimately fostering a more socially cohesive community.  Moreover, there's a growing trend, especially among younger generations, towards lesser car ownership and driving (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend is driven by factors such as increased access to public transportation, the feasibility of telecommuting due to advances in technology, and changing social attitudes that prioritize sustainability. Correspondingly, there's evidence of auto companies diversifying their offerings by pitching themselves as mobility companies, reflecting an acknowledgment of this ongoing shift (Rosenthal, 2013).  In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages to both our environment and quality of life. The experiences of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota point towards a sustainable urban future where reduced car usage characterizes our transportation habits. Furthermore, younger generations are naturally adopting these patterns, implying that this trend is likely to continue. Therefore, as inhabitants of this shared planet, it behooves us to adopt strategies that promote less car use and push for sustainable urban living.\",\n",
       " 'When you think about limiting car usage you might think \"Well how am I supposed to get there. Theres no way i\\'m able to get to my destination without a car.\" Yes, I\\'m pretty sure we all would\\'nt want to walk five thousand miles to visit a friend three hours away, but here me out. Doesnt a car make you all tired? Knowing you have to pay a bill every month, or getting gas four times a week. Just imagine a world where thats not a problem.  In Vauban Germany they are most of the time a car free zone. Owners of cars aren\\'t allowed to have cars in there garage or in the streets or wherever a car would normally be. They have to keep there cars in a space they buy at the edge of the community for 40,000 plus the paying for their homes. Now I wouldnt want to pay all this money to park my car. Most people in suburban homes sold their vehicles so that they could live there without a problem. Heidren Walter said,\" When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" She says as she\\'s walking down the street she can actual listen to the community of children playing and not be drown out from the loud motor in the car.  Now, limiting car usage doesnt mean we all have to walk to our destinations. We could start using bicycles more often and actually get a benefit of working out. Sure it might make you all sweaty and gross. But make a plan to get up a little earlier and then wash up at wherever it is you are to be. And limiting cars doesnt mean every single one of us need to give up our cars. Instead we can find a friend who lives near to us or a fellow coworker and car pool. Instead of all two hundred employes lugging their cars on the road and getting stuck in torturous traffic. make a plan to get five people in a car and instead of two hundred cars on their way to work, there would only be about fourty cars going to the same place. That would clear up our roads and reduce traffic. In France Congestion was down sixty percent after reducing cars.  \"Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Westurn Europe..\" ,according to Robert Duffer. People today are now worrying to much on their cars and how much it will cost them. Not worrying about jobs and insurance. The invention of the car was not to see who can get the most miles or whos car gets better horse power. It was about helping people get from A to B, and we can do just that.  There are many people out here who will think that limiting car use is a waste of time and like to keep things the same. But we can be the generation who changes that. If we could go down to one car a family and start car pooling with one another, or even start using bikes to go to places with our friends, we can help make the community a better place. One day just try. Try walking to the super market. Instead of making your mom drive you and your friends to the mall, try making a plan to all ride your bikes there. It doesnt hurt to try, so try to start.',\n",
       " 'Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By implementing strategies to reduce dependence on cars, such as car-free zones and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create safer, healthier, and more sustainable communities.  One of the primary benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to research cited in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing reliance on cars, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change.  Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution highlights how car emissions contribute to smog and poor air quality in cities. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for citizens.  Limiting car usage also has positive effects on public health. As mentioned in the passage about Vauban, Germany, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. This is because relying on cars can often lead to traffic congestion, long commutes, and increased stress levels. By creating car-free zones and promoting alternative transportation options, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall well-being of citizens.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can foster more connected and vibrant communities. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, describes how millions of residents hiked, biked, or took buses to work during a car-free day, resulting in streets devoid of traffic jams. This not only promotes alternative transportation but also creates opportunities for people to interact with each other, leading to stronger social connections and a sense of community.  Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to economic benefits. The passage about the United States decreasing car ownership and driving miles suggests that it may have a long-term cultural shift with implications for the car industry. While this shift may have negative effects on car manufacturers, it can result in positive economic changes in other areas. For example, as more people rely on alternative modes of transportation, there may be increased demand for public transit systems, bike-sharing programs, and other related industries.  In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting public health, fostering connected communities, and potentially bringing economic benefits, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential that we prioritize implementing strategies to limit car usage and promote alternative transportation options for the benefit of all.',\n",
       " 'Many places around the world have been taking charge and limiting car use to the public. There comes some great advantages when doing this. You can help limit greenhouse gases, relieve the stress from cars, and become less dependent on your car for transportation.  The big advantage about limiting cars is to help prevent the rapid spread of greenhouse gases the creates smog in cities. From source two you learn that cold nights and warm days cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions polluting cities even more. With these dangerous gases in the air, the world is in great danger of becoming unhealthy and we are to blame for this awful cause because of the over use of cars. By limiting the use of cars you limit the amount of pollution in the air.  By limiting car use an finding other means of transportation, you can actually relieve stress put on you from the constant beeping and noises made by cars. By walking or riding a bike you hear the nice peaceful sounds of the great outdoors while knowing you are doing good to you and the environment. Some people, as seen in source three, have taken this experience of the limiting of cars to share the experience with their companion riding a twoseated bike. \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" By limiting the use of cars you begin to be less depended on cars. By this happening you learn your life will know longer be circled around your car and you begin to see that driving a car everyday is not really needed. By using public transportation of carpooling you greatly decrease the amount of pollution in the air while also having a ride to work or where ever you need to be.  Limiting cars can have multiple advantages to it. You can help stop half of the greenhouse gases that are caused from cars, relieve stress, and become less dependent for the need a car. This will cause you to become a better citizen and help make the world last longer for hundreds of generations to come.',\n",
       " 'Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there\\'s always a negative pollution. Although mobile transportation are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmful greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.  A small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a \"carfree\" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by farend highways. Although Vauban is not completely carfree, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.  Another insight to reduced car zones brings Paris\\' incident with smog. Paris\\' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with evennumbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with oddnumbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.  Could you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a carfree day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a carfree lifestyle has it\\'s hassles, but in hindsight, it has it\\'s benefits.  To conclude, living a carfree lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere worldwide would take part in airpollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.',\n",
       " \"Code  Dear State Senator’s Name,  I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or replaced by a popular vote system in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from various perspectives, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for five key reasons.  Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputed outcomes are less likely under this system compared to a direct popular vote. In an era with highly polarized politics, maintaining a system that ensures a definitive winner is crucial in avoiding extended election crises.  Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents all regions of the country. With each region having a different set of interests and concerns, it is important for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas and neglecting the concerns of smaller states. By requiring candidates to gain support from multiple regions, the Electoral College system helps preserve a sense of inclusiveness in the election process.  Thirdly, the Electoral College promotes the importance of swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates are incentivized to campaign heavily in states where the outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates, leading to more thoughtful decision-making. Ensuring that the swing states decide the election helps maximize voter engagement and enhances the overall quality of democratic decision-making.  Furthermore, the Electoral College restores political balance by giving some weight to large states. Although the Senate already provides a system of representation that balances the power between larger and smaller states, the Electoral College further reinforces this balance. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states naturally receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, thereby ensuring that the concerns of both small and large states are taken into account.  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the Electoral College automatically produces a clear winner. This prevents the need for complex and time-consuming run-off elections, which would only complicate the electoral process. The Electoral College simplifies the process and ensures that a single candidate emerges as the legitimate winner.  While I understand the arguments in favor of a popular vote system, such as the idea that it is more democratic and prevents the disenfranchisement of voters in states with no chance of winning, I believe that the current Electoral College system balances these concerns effectively.  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved due to the certainty of outcome it provides, its ability to ensure that the President represents all regions of the country, the importance it places on swing states, the balance it restores to large states, and its ability to avoid run-off elections. These practical reasons outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system and demonstrate the strengths of the Electoral College in our democratic process.  Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the pros and cons of both systems in making your decision.  Sincerely,  Your Name\",\n",
       " 'Cars are a major aspect of transportation in the twentyfirst century. Having the hottest, newest, model of vehicle is all the craze in todays carloving society. But new research shows that cars are becoming a leading contributor to the pollution of major cities world wide, and cities all across the globe are doing whatever they can to help prevent the pollution.  Eupore has always fancied its luxurious cars, especially in upscale communities. But in recent years countries such as germany and France have made efforts to reduce the amount of cars on the streets in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the air. A new upscale community in Vauban, Germany has been built completely on the basis of no cars. Seventy percent of the residents of this community do not own cars, and those who do own cars, must keep them outside of the community. Many residents here feel that having no cars gives them a little peace of mind. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban says, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\" A major upside to not owning a car is the relief from stress. Many people have many worries about their cars whether it will work, the amount of gas in it, the cost of gas, and so on. Getting rid of the problem also gets rid of the worry. Getting rid of cars also allows new opportunities for better city building. making cities and suburbs denser discourages the need for cars and promotes the idea of walking, biking, or skating to a destination.  The United States has always loved its cars, but recently many people have taken to the sidewalks instead of taking to the streets. Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in America and it seems to be declining. studies find that after 2005, many Americans began to stop buysing cars and started to find other ways to go from point A to point B. Many people credit this fact to the recession around 2008. After the down turn, people became more money contious, and the unemployed didn\\'t need to go anywhere anyway. With no cars, Americans can save thousands of dollars a year because of no payments and not having to pay those expensive gas prices! The fewer cars on the street has also had a positive impact on the environment. Less greenhouse gases has made the air in the suburbs and some cities much cleaner. Technology has also made a huge impact on our commute. People connected with friends and family without even having to drive and visit them, and teleconfernces across countries and continents have reduced the need to drive or fly places to do buisness. Many mojor car producig companies have also rebranded themselves in order to make personal transportation a thing of the past and make mass public transportation a obtainable goal.  Smog is a big issue, not only in the United States, but also in places such as Erope and Latin America, both of which have started to make efforts on cleaning the air and redcing the amount of cars on the road. In the 1990\\'s Bogota, Colombia started a tradition in which the citizens find alternative ways of trasportation to work and shops one day out of the year, and for three straight years, cars have been banned in the streets on this \"holiday.\" Because this event has grown so poular, many people have started to practice life without cars on a daily basis. New parks have formed, hundreds of biking paths have been added throughout the city, and upscale resturants and stores have began to pop up in the city. The carfree lifestyle has definitely effected Bogota, Colombia. Europe has also had a great quarrel with its smog problem in recent years, and Frane has been making an effort to stop the smog problem from getting any bigger. Paris recently put a ban on driving in the city in effort to reduce smog. On Monday, divers with even license plates were asked to find other ways of transportation, and on Tuesday drivers with odd license plates could not drive. The population did not have a very positive reaction, but the congestion of cars in the capital did go down sixty percent on both days, and the efforts worked so well, the city was able to lift the ban after on week.  Car culture has been a part of our societ for a long time. However, large strides have been made all across the globe in order to reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of pollution in the air. These strides have had many positive impacts on the communities they have served in and continute to make tomorrow a better and cleaner world.',\n",
       " 'There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The majority of people that own a car have a lot of stress due to gas money and paying for the car. Owning a car is a serious expense. There are other types of transportation that can be useful for the people.  According to Source 1, in Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the people that live there do not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car in order to move there. People were starting to realize that when they owned a car they would always be tense. After getting rid of the car, they have been much happier and less stressed.  Since there are less cars in the streets of Germany, people have stopped and realized how beautiful everything was. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, is now relived as she walks the verdant streets where she can hear the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children.  In Paris, France due to the cold nights and warm days, the car emissions have been trapped by the warmer layer of air. Sometimes, weather can be the effect of something bad happening to your car. In the everyday world, people have been killed and have been in serious accidents. Not only because of the weather but also because of the lack of responsibility and concentration it takes to drive a vehicle.  As said in Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia many people do not drive cars. The majority of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work or wherever they need to go. The goal of this is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, said \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" while he was riding his bicycle along with his wife next to him.  As people ride bike or hike or even just walk around their city, they can see and learn many new things just by being more aware of their surroundings. Cars have been in this world for a long period of time already. It\\'s time to take a break from the madness and start realizing how beautiful life is and how beautiful it can be by not destroying it with such a machine. Not only will there be less stress, but the world will be a lot more safer than it was.',\n",
       " 'Your Name Your Address City, State, ZIP Email Address Phone Number Date  Senator\\'s Name Senator\\'s Address City, State, ZIP  Dear Senator\\'s Name,  I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After considering the arguments from different sources, including the texts \"What Is the Electoral College?\" published by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be preserved.  One of the main reasons for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of the outcome. As pointed out by Judge Posner, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral vote tends to exceed their share of the popular vote, due to the winner-takes-all system in most states. This ensures a clear winner in the presidential election, reducing the potential for prolonged uncertainty and legal battles.  Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who appeals to a broad range of regions. According to Judge Posner, no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president, so candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This encourages candidates to campaign in different states, including swing states, rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas. As a result, presidential candidates are incentivized to address the concerns and interests of voters across the country, ensuring that they are accountable to a diverse range of constituents.  The Electoral College also gives smaller states a voice in the presidential election. Plumer highlights that the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large states over small states, which is necessary due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By granting each state a minimum of three electoral votes, including smaller states like Wyoming, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates cannot exclusively prioritize the needs of heavily populated states. This system ensures that the concerns and interests of citizens residing in smaller states are not overshadowed by those in larger states.  Finally, the Electoral College supports the stability and continuity of the political process by avoiding run-off elections. Plumer mentions that run-off elections become a possibility when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. Implementing run-off elections would significantly complicate the presidential election process and potentially lead to greater uncertainty and division. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College facilitates a smooth transition of power and prevents the need for additional rounds of voting.  While arguments for a popular vote system are valid, such as the idea that it provides a sense of fairness or avoids the concentration of campaign efforts in swing states, the Electoral College addresses these concerns in different ways. The Electoral College offers a balance between popular will and the need for small states to have a say in the election, ensuring that presidential candidates have a broad appeal, and providing certainty and stability to the election process.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be preserved. Despite some criticisms and calls for change in recent years, the Electoral College system has proven to be a practical and reliable method of electing the president. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, protects the representation of smaller states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. I urge you to consider these factors when making decisions regarding the Electoral College.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Sincerely,  Your Name',\n",
       " 'Now a days you see everyone with cars driving to places instead of walking. There are some small towns that cars are not needed because everything is so close but other cities everyone has to drive because everything is very distant from one another. Cars are needed on a daily basis to get to school, or to get to their job but walking or even biking would be a great idea because you would not be poluting the environment there would be less traffic jams and it would reduce the greenhouse gas. Limiting car usage would be a great idea and it would make peoples life a lot better and healthier because instead of driving they would walk to take a bike.  Polution is a big problem especially in big cities because everyone is driving and the smoke the cars leave makes our environment gross. Polution is not only because of the smoke the cars produce, it can also be when someone throws plastic into the oceans and poluting the waters or having trash in parks without recycling. I think we should reenforce the recycling systems because many people dont know the benefits to that and how better our community and even world could be. When your are driving a car and especially in big cities like New York you need a car everywhere or just take the taxi. But just taking the taxi it wont reduce the probablity of polluting the air, it will still have the same effect as if you were driving your own car. If people would just walk or bike to their job or to their school poluting the air would not be a problem just like stated in source 2. In source 2 it talks about how in Paris they would fine the people up to 31 dollars.  There would also be less traffic jams due to the limiting of car usage just like stated in Source 3. In source 3 it talks about how in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that the colombians would ride their bike skate or take the bus and there would be less traffic jams. That is a very good idea because no one likes to be stuck in traffic especially if your in a hurry to get to work or even school. Traffic jams occur because of so many cars on the road. There is a thing called Rush hour and that is when everyone is leaving their work or school and they are going home and that is when everyone is on the road and thats when their is the most traffic. But it would be much easier if you would just bike or walk or take a bus and tried to avoid all of those traffic jams. The program that Bogota, Colombia has created is something that should be done nationwide because it would help so many other countries. Thanks to that programm people would go to the park and do sports and take walks.  Source A talks about the Greenhouse gas and how in Vauban,Germany soccer moms gave up their cars and how the streets were \" Car Free\". That led to having 70 percent of the families in Vauban to not having cars and 57 percent of the people that moved to Vauban to sell their cars. According to this source a person said they are much happier not owning or having a car because when Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother had a car she said she was more tense. Apperently this movement was called \" Smart Planning\".  Limiting car usage would be a great benefit to people and a great idea to improve Earth. Pollution like mentioned before is one of the biggest problems we have and in big cities is an evern bigger problem. Traffic jams is something that will be hard to stop because everyone is using cars and will continue to use cars because it seems like thats the fastest way to get to your location but thats not accurate because if people think that way then thats the cause of traffic jams and thats the cause of the Rush hour. The movement in Vauban, Germany is something that people should do. Im not saying sell your car but to reduce the car usage is something that would be very helpful not only to you, but for the environment.',\n",
       " 'Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit our society. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to separate suburban life from auto use, known as \"smart planning.\" This movement acknowledges that automobiles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage, we can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.  One successful example of limiting car usage is the German suburb of Vauban. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, making the streets completely \"car-free\" except for the main thoroughfare with a tram to downtown Freiburg (Rosenthal, 2009). As a result of this car-free lifestyle, 70 percent of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there (Rosenthal, 2009). The residents of Vauban have experienced the benefits of limiting car usage firsthand. They report feeling less stressed and happier without the constant reliance on cars (Rosenthal, 2009). This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to improved quality of life for individuals.  The benefits of limiting car usage are not limited to individual well-being. By reducing car dependency, we can also make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. Smart planning focuses on placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of distant malls accessed by highways (Rosenthal, 2009). This makes it easier for residents to rely on public transportation and encourages walking or cycling for short distances. Additionally, limiting car usage can address the issue of smog caused by car emissions. In cities like Paris, driving bans have been enforced during periods of intense smog to reduce air pollution (Duffer, 2014). These bans have seen a significant decrease in congestion and smog levels (Duffer, 2014).   Furthermore, limiting car usage can have long-term benefits for our environment. A cultural shift towards reducing car ownership and driving has already been observed in the United States. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend, if it persists, will have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, making it crucial to limit car usage to achieve the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2013).   In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By focusing on smart planning and reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and combat climate change. The success stories of communities like Vauban in Germany and the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrate the positive impact of such measures. It is essential that we prioritize the development of car-reduced communities and encourage the adoption of alternative forms of transportation. The shift away from car culture is not only beneficial for our environment but also for the overall well-being of individuals and communities.',\n",
       " \"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  The modern world has been engineered for cars, but with climate change becoming an undeniable reality, it is imperative to rethink this structure. Evidence from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the United States suggests that decreasing car usage yields a multitude of environmental, societal, and personal benefits (Rosenthal, Duffer, Selsky).  In Vauban, Germany, a community free from street parking, driveways, and home garages, 70% of families live without cars. Owing to the restricted availability of parking spaces, the community has witnessed a drastic decrease in car usage, fostering a healthier environment with lesser greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal).   Cars, although an integral aspect of suburban life, contribute significantly to greenhouse emissions, with up to 50% of the emissions in the U.S coming from car-intensive areas. Moreover, the prevalence of cars in developed and developing nations' suburbs is also a significant contributor to air pollution. The movement towards car-free or reduced car communities, such as Vauban, demonstrates the positive environmental effects of limiting car usage (Rosenthal).  Decreasing car usage is not only environmentally beneficial but also positively affects public health. Paris's partial ban on driving amid heavy pollution resulted in a staggering 60% decrease in congestion, thereby reducing the levels of harmful pollutants in the air (Duffer). The harmful effects of car emissions extend beyond environmental degradation, as they also contribute significantly to poor air quality and related health issues.  Similarly, Bogota, Colombia experienced the benefits of car-free days firsthand. The once congested streets became avenues for alternative, sustainable forms of transportation. This shift elicits a dual benefit – significantly reducing air pollution and promoting physical activity (Selsky).  The trend of reducing car reliance is not limited solely to international communities. The United States bears witness to a slight shift in behavior, with studies suggesting a decrease in car purchases and miles driven. As more people turn to public transportation and sharing services, the possibilities of a less car-dependent society become more tangible (Rosenthal).  Conclusively, lesser reliance on cars presents several advantages. For one, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions, thereby mitigating climate change and improving air quality. This, in turn, alleviates public health risks associated with air pollution. The use of alternative forms of transportation promotes physical health. Thus, working towards societies that are not centred around cars benefits the environment, public health, and overall quality of life.\",\n",
       " 'All throughout the world, experiments are taking place that replace the personal automobile with safer and more environment sensitive choices. Life in places, such as Vauban, Germany, is built around the lack of cars. Bogota, Colombia hosts their own Day Without Cars. Although this scale of events hasn\\'t happened America yet, the youth of the United States aren\\'t using cars as much as they used to. In all these cases, quality of life has improved and the environment isn\\'t suffering as much as it previously did.  The residents of Vauban, Germany have made a monumental decision in the aspect of cars. According to the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , in the new district of Freiburg, the only cars that run in the streets are the trams that run to downtown Freiburg. This is done so that \"stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.\" This \"smart planning\" allows people to get to where they need to go without using cars. Placing busy businesses on a main street would normally be a bad idea because of the amount of congestion it would cause. In places like this, congestion isn\\'t a thing that can happen. A walk could get you to central places allowing you to access the more important of places. The same article states that \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emitions.\" The environment is in a state of constant decline with the amount of greenhouse gasses and chemicals we are exposing to it. The lack of cars is a great way to put us in the right direction. The article mentions that cars were responsible for \"up to 50 percent of greenhouse gasses in some carintensive ares in the United States.\" Imagine how much clearer the sky would be with smog reduced by half. The implications of removing cars from our lives could mean the difference between severe global warming and living happy and healthy.  Three cities, deep within the Colombian urban areas, host a day where cars are not allowed. Andrew Selsky describes how \"parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven,pitted sidewalks rushhour traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\" In Bogota, this singular day where cars were banned gave people a reason to try out public transportation and personal locomotion. Paris took a similar approach when, According to Robert Duffer, they \"enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of he global city.\" Cars with evennumbered license plates were enforced to not be driven. The oddnumbered plates were the ones that were taken off the streets the next day. The two day ban allowed the environment to recover after extremely high smog levels. The rule that was applied in the Colombian cities was also enforced in the worldwide city of Paris. Both cities benefited greatly from a temporary ban of cars.  Car culture has always been strong within America. Elisabeth Rosunthal implies that for several decades, cars were a musthave object, but now, the youth are not as interested as the previous generations. Rosunthal shows how \"America\\'s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miled driven in the United States peaked in 200 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspecive.\" If the largest cities stopped relying on cars as much, everybody would benefit. Even the car companies would have something to gain with advances in more personal vehicles such as bicycles. The environment would have an immense amount of weight taken off of its shoulders. In the US, where the 2nd highest source of environmental harm is cars, the impact would be monumental. The article relates that \"people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume hte habit.\" Teens all across America are carpooling and finding new ways to help the environment while also getting to where they need to go.  Life is getting too busy. There is always something that needs to be done. Cars may help but there will never be enough hours in the day to do everything. Leaving personal transportation behind will be the next big step towards a more relaxed and stressless life. The advantages easily outweigh the disadvantages.',\n",
       " 'Limiting car usage is a step towards addressing various social and environmental challenges, such as air pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and even certain health concerns related to sedentary lifestyle. It is indeed necessary for us to understand the advantages of limiting car usage as highlighted in multiple passages studied.  First and foremost, limiting car usage significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. In the passage by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is emphasized that passenger cars account for \"12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\" and \"up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (Rosenthal, 2009). Reducing these emissions, as we see in Vauban, Germany, leads to cleaner air and lower levels of smog. Similar reports come out of Paris, where a partial driving ban resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and smog levels (Duffer, 2014).   Furthermore, restricting the use of personal vehicles creates a more people-friendly urban environment, leading to higher quality of life and potentially boosting physical activity. Vauban\\'s verdant streets were marked by the noise of \"bicycles and the chatter of wandering children,\" not the humdrum of motors (Rosenthal, 2009). Similarly, during a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, millions of people chose alternative, and often more active, modes of transport such as walking, biking, or skating, hence reducing smog and promoting healthier lifestyle (Selsky, 2002).   Limiting car usage also seems to align with the behaviour of younger generations, who appear less reliant on personal automobiles. It\\'s suggested that rates of car ownership have started falling, especially amongst younger people, and there has been a concurrent rise in the use of public transportation, cycling, and walking (Rosenthal, 2013).   Interestingly, this change in behavior might not stem from environmental motives alone, but also from the influence of technology, shifts toward urban living, and, perhaps, a lessening cultural fixation on automobiles (Rosenthal, 2013). Significantly, this trend has not disrupted the transportation industry but instead prompted it to conceptualize \"cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network\" (Rosenthal, 2013).  In conclusion, limiting car usage is far from a purely restrictive measure. By lowering greenhouse emissions and pollution, promoting a shift towards healthier means of transportation, and fostering more pedestrian-friendly spaces, we stand to improve our quality of life and our environment. Meanwhile, trends suggest that such changes are not only feasible, but they could also represent our transportation future. Indeed, the transformation of our car culture could be one of the most dynamic and beneficent aspects of contemporary urban development.']"
